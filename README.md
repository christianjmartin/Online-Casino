INSTALLATION: 

      - Make sure you have an enviornment on your local machine that is able to compile and run C++.
      - Open a new workspace and create five files:
            1. main.cpp (C++ source code file)
            2. blackjack.h (C++ header file for blackjack)
            3. deckOfCards.txt (text file for a deck of cards)
            4. roulette.h (C++ header file for roulette)
            5. roulette.txt (text file showing color/number for a roulette spinner)

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the commond prompt "g++ FILENAME.cpp" to make and "./a.out" to compile
      - Once compiled, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
