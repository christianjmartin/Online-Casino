INSTALLATION: 

      - Make sure you have an enviornment on your local machine that is able to compile and run C++.
      - Open a new workspace and create six files, and copy and paste the content into them from the files above in which share the same name
            1. main.cpp (C++ source code file)
            2. blackjack.h (C++ header file for blackjack)
            3. deckOfCards.txt (text file for a deck of cards)

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the command prompt "g++ FILENAME.cpp" to compile and "./a.out" to run
      - Once running, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
