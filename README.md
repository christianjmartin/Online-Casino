INSTALLATION: 

      - Make sure you have an enviornment on your local machine that is able to compile and run C++.
      - Download the zip file and open them on said enviornment
      - Alternatively, you can simply clone the content of this repository

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the command prompt "g++ FILENAME.cpp" to compile and "./a.out" to run
      - Once running, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
